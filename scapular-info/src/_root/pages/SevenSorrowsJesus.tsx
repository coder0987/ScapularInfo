                        These prayers, given by Our Lord to St. Bridget of Sweden, are to be prayed daily for twelve years. 
                        Our Lord promised to all who pray them the five graces listed below.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pr">
                        At the completion, they would have honored each of the

                        If the person praying these prayers dies before the twelve years are over, Our Lord will accept them as having been prayed in their entirety.
                        If a day or two are missed due to a valid reason, they can be made up later.

                        O Jesus, now I wish to pray the Lord's Prayer seven times in unity with the love with which You sanctified this prayer in Your Heart.
                        Take it from my lips into Your Divine Heart.
                        Improve and complete it so much that it brings as much honor and joy to the Trinity as You granted it on earth with this prayer.
                        May these pour upon Your Holy Humanity in glorification to Your painful wounds and the Precious Blood that You spilled from them.
