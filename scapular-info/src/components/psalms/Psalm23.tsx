                    THE earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof: *
                    the world and all they that dwell therein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For He hath founded it upon the seas, *
                    and hath prepared it upon the rivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who shall go up to the mountain of the Lord? *
                    Or who shall stand in His holy place?
                </p>
                <p>
                    He that hath clean hands and a pure heart *
                    who hath not taken his sould in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, *
                    and mercy from God his Savior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the generation of them that seek Him: *
                    of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be lifted up, O eternal gates: *
                    and the King of glory shall enter in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who is this King of glory? *
                    The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.
