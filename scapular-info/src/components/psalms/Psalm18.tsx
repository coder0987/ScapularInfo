                <p>
                    THE heavens are telling the glory of God: *
                    and the firmament declareth the works of His hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Day unto day uttereth speech: *
                    and night unto night showeth knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unto all the earth their sound hath gone forth, *
                    and their words unto the ends of the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the sun hath He set His tabernacle, *
                    and as a bridegroom cometh out of his bride chamber.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He hath rejoiced as a giant to run his course: *
                    His going forth is from the end of heaven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And his course even unto the end thereof: *
                    and there is none that is hid from his heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The law of the Lord is without spot, converting souls: *
                    the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: *
                    the commandment of hte Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring forever and ever: *
                    the judgements of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More to be desired are they than gold and many precious stones: *
                    and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Thy servant keepeth them: *
                    and in keeping them there is great reward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who understandeth his sins? From my secret ones cleanse me, *
                    and from strangers spare Thy servant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If they have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: *
                    and I shall be cleansed from grievous sin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the sayings of my mouth *
                    and meditation of my heart in Thy sight shall be ever pleasing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    O Lord, my helper *
                    and my Redeemer.
                </p>
                <GloriaPatri />
